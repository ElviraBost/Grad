Allow inbound HTTP access from anywhere

Allow inbound SSH traffic from your computer's public IP address so
that you can connect to your instance

To create and configure your security group:
1. Decide who may access your instance, for example, a single computer or all trusted computers on a network. For this tutorial, you can use the public IP address of your computer.
 To find your IP address, use the checkip service from AWS3 or search for the phrase "what is my IP address" in any Internet search engine.
If you are connecting through an ISP or from behind your firewall  without a static IP address, you will need to find the range of IP addresses used by client computers.
 If you don't know this address range, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 for this tutorial. However, this is unsafe for production environments because it allows everyone to access your instance using SSH.

2. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
3. In the navigation bar, verify that US West (Oregon) is the selected
region.
4. In the left-hand navigation bar, choose Security Groups, and then click
Create Security Group.
5. In Security group name enter WebServerSG and provide a description.
6. Choose your VPC from the list.
7. On the Inbound tab, add the rules as follows:

a. Click Add Rule, and then choose SSH from the Type list. Under Source, select Custom and in the text box enter the public IP
address range that you decided on in step 1.
b. Click Add Rule, and then choose HTTP from the Type list.
c. Click Add Rule, and then choose Custom TCP Rule from the
Type list. Under Port Range enter 8080.
8. Click Create.
